# 13) Recommendations & Options

* **Stick with Supabase** for v1. It hits auth/DB/RLS/Realtime in one shot and keeps you shipping fast.
* **Hono + Netlify Functions** is a sweet spot: tiny, fast, and portable if you change hosts later.
* **Zod** everywhere: request bodies, env validation, response shapes.
* **PostHog** over Plausible if you want feature flags and cohorts; Plausible if you want dead-simple analytics.
* **shadcn/ui** for speed and a clean look; it reads well with your audience mix.
* **Keep persona-first UX** — it’s your differentiator for conversion.
