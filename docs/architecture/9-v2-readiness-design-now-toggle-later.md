# 9) v2 Readiness (Design Now, Toggle Later)

* **Stripe**: model `subscriptions` and `entitlements` now; hide UI behind flags.
* **Orgs/Seats/RBAC**: add `orgs`, `org_members`, and policy scaffolding; keep UX off until needed.
* **Courses**: store `content_modules` as teasers now; design `courses`/`enrollments` schema for later.
* **Exec Chatbot**: v1 beta with rate limits; v2 adds **org context**, **longer memory**, **auditability**.
