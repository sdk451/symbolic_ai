# Story Prioritization Matrix

## Prioritization Framework

**Business Value (1-5 scale):**
- 5: Critical for MVP launch and revenue generation
- 4: High impact on user experience and conversion
- 3: Moderate impact on user engagement
- 2: Low impact but supports platform growth
- 1: Nice-to-have features

**Technical Complexity (1-5 scale):**
- 5: High complexity, multiple integrations, significant risk
- 4: Moderate complexity, some integrations required
- 3: Standard complexity, follows existing patterns
- 2: Low complexity, minimal integration
- 1: Very simple, isolated changes

**Dependencies:**
- **Critical Path**: Must be completed before other stories
- **High Dependency**: Depends on other stories for full functionality
- **Medium Dependency**: Some dependencies but can be partially developed
- **Low Dependency**: Minimal dependencies, can be developed independently

## Epic 1: MVP Core Platform (Critical Path)

| Story | Business Value | Technical Complexity | Dependencies | Priority Score | Rank |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------|
| 1.1 User Auth & Onboarding | 5 | 3 | Critical Path | 8 | 1 |
| 1.2 Personalized Dashboard | 5 | 3 | Depends on 1.1 | 8 | 2 |
| 1.3 Secure Demo Execution | 5 | 5 | Depends on 1.1, 1.2 | 10 | 3 |
| 1.4 Consultation Booking | 4 | 3 | Depends on 1.1, 1.2 | 7 | 4 |

**Epic 1 Analysis:**
- **Critical Path**: All stories are essential for MVP launch
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Must be completed in order (1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4)
- **High Business Value**: Core platform functionality
- **Risk Mitigation**: Story 1.3 has highest complexity and risk

## Epic 2: Phase 1.5 Incremental Enhancements

| Story | Business Value | Technical Complexity | Dependencies | Priority Score | Rank |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------|
| 2.1 Expanded Demo Library | 4 | 2 | Depends on 1.3 | 6 | 5 |
| 2.2 Executive Chatbot Beta | 3 | 4 | Depends on 1.2 | 7 | 6 |
| 2.3 File Upload Support | 3 | 4 | Depends on 1.3 | 7 | 7 |
| 2.4 Automated Email Drips | 3 | 3 | Depends on 1.1 | 6 | 8 |

**Epic 2 Analysis:**
- **Post-MVP**: Can be developed after core platform is stable
- **Parallel Development**: Stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 can be developed in parallel
- **Moderate Business Value**: Enhances user experience and engagement

## Epic 4: Security & Infrastructure Foundation

| Story | Business Value | Technical Complexity | Dependencies | Priority Score | Rank |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------|
| 4.1 Advanced Security Model | 4 | 4 | Depends on 1.3 | 8 | 9 |
| 4.2 Infrastructure Monitoring | 3 | 3 | Can start early | 6 | 10 |
| 4.3 Backup & Disaster Recovery | 3 | 3 | Can start early | 6 | 11 |
| 4.4 Compliance & Audit Framework | 2 | 4 | Depends on 4.1 | 6 | 12 |
| 4.5 Operational Excellence | 2 | 3 | Depends on 4.2, 4.3 | 5 | 13 |

**Epic 4 Analysis:**
- **Foundation Work**: Critical for platform stability and compliance
- **Parallel Development**: Stories 4.2 and 4.3 can start early
- **Security Priority**: Story 4.1 should be prioritized after MVP core

## Epic 5: Analytics & Observability Platform

| Story | Business Value | Technical Complexity | Dependencies | Priority Score | Rank |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|------|
| 5.1 Analytics Dashboard | 3 | 3 | Depends on 1.1, 1.2 | 6 | 14 |
| 5.2 User Behavior Tracking | 2 | 3 | Depends on 5.1 | 5 | 15 |
| 5.3 Business Intelligence | 2 | 4 | Depends on 5.1 | 6 | 16 |
| 5.4 A/B Testing Framework | 2 | 4 | Depends on 5.1 | 6 | 17 |
| 5.5 System Observability | 2 | 3 | Depends on 4.2 | 5 | 18 |

**Epic 5 Analysis:**
- **Post-MVP**: Can be developed after core platform and user base established
- **Data-Driven**: Requires existing user data and interactions
- **Lower Priority**: Important for optimization but not critical for launch
