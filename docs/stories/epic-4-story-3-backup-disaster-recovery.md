# Story 4.3: Backup & Disaster Recovery

## User Story

As a **platform administrator and business stakeholder**,
I want **comprehensive backup and disaster recovery procedures**,
So that **business operations can continue with minimal data loss and downtime in case of system failures**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Supabase database, file storage, application data, configuration
- Technology: Supabase backup systems, cloud storage, disaster recovery tools
- Follows pattern: Existing data management and system administration patterns
- Touch points: All data storage systems, configuration management, deployment systems

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Automated Backups**: Daily automated backups of all critical data and configurations
2. **Backup Verification**: Regular verification of backup integrity and restore capability
3. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Documented procedures for system recovery and business continuity
4. **Recovery Testing**: Regular testing of disaster recovery procedures and recovery time objectives
5. **Data Retention**: Appropriate data retention policies and secure deletion procedures
6. **Cross-Region Backup**: Backups stored in multiple geographic regions for redundancy

**Integration Requirements:**

7. **Existing Systems**: Backup procedures integrated with all existing data systems
8. **Deployment Integration**: Recovery procedures integrated with existing deployment processes
9. **Monitoring Integration**: Backup status monitoring integrated with existing monitoring systems

**Quality Requirements:**

10. **Recovery Time**: Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) defined and met
11. **Data Integrity**: Backup and recovery procedures maintain data integrity
12. **Business Continuity**: Procedures ensure minimal business disruption during recovery

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Implement automated backup systems with disaster recovery procedures
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Build on existing data management and system administration practices
- **Key Constraints**: Must ensure data integrity and meet business continuity requirements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Automated backup system implemented and operational
- [ ] Backup verification procedures established and tested
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan documented and approved
- [ ] Recovery testing procedures implemented and scheduled
- [ ] Data retention policies defined and implemented
- [ ] Cross-region backup storage configured
- [ ] Recovery procedures integrated with deployment systems
- [ ] Backup monitoring integrated with alerting systems
- [ ] Business continuity procedures documented
- [ ] Team training completed on backup and recovery procedures

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Backup failures or recovery procedures not working when needed
**Mitigation:** Regular testing, multiple backup methods, comprehensive documentation
**Rollback:** Multiple backup options available, ability to restore from different points

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing data systems
- [ ] Backup procedures don't impact system performance
- [ ] Recovery procedures work with existing deployment processes
- [ ] Data integrity maintained throughout backup and recovery
