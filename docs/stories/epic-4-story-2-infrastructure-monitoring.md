# Story 4.2: Infrastructure Monitoring & Alerting

## User Story

As a **platform administrator and operations team**,
I want **comprehensive monitoring and alerting across all system components**,
So that **I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All system components (Supabase, Netlify, n8n, APIs, databases)
- Technology: Monitoring tools (DataDog/New Relic), logging systems, alerting platforms
- Follows pattern: Existing logging and error tracking patterns
- Touch points: All system components, application metrics, infrastructure metrics

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Application Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of API endpoints, response times, error rates
2. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Server resources, database performance, external service health
3. **User Experience Monitoring**: Real user monitoring, page load times, user journey tracking
4. **Alerting System**: Automated alerts for critical issues, performance degradation, errors
5. **Dashboard Creation**: Operational dashboards for system health and performance metrics
6. **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with search, filtering, and analysis capabilities

**Integration Requirements:**

7. **Existing Systems**: Monitoring integrated with all existing system components
8. **Alerting Integration**: Alerts integrated with existing communication channels (Slack, email)
9. **Performance Baseline**: Monitoring establishes performance baselines for existing functionality

**Quality Requirements:**

10. **Proactive Detection**: Issues detected before user impact
11. **Actionable Alerts**: Alerts provide clear information for troubleshooting
12. **Historical Analysis**: Historical data available for trend analysis and capacity planning

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Deploy monitoring agents and configure alerting across all system components
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Build on existing logging and error tracking infrastructure
- **Key Constraints**: Must provide comprehensive coverage without impacting system performance

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Application monitoring deployed across all API endpoints
- [ ] Infrastructure monitoring configured for all system components
- [ ] User experience monitoring implemented
- [ ] Alerting system configured with appropriate thresholds
- [ ] Operational dashboards created and accessible
- [ ] Log aggregation system operational
- [ ] Alert integration with communication channels working
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Monitoring documentation and runbooks created
- [ ] Team training completed on monitoring tools

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Monitoring overhead impacting system performance or false positive alerts
**Mitigation:** Careful monitoring configuration, performance testing, alert tuning
**Rollback:** Ability to disable specific monitoring or adjust alert thresholds

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing system functionality
- [ ] Monitoring doesn't impact system performance
- [ ] Alerting doesn't create noise or false positives
- [ ] Historical data collection doesn't impact storage
