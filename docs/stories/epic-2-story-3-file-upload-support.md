# Story 2.3: File Upload Support

## User Story

As a **user wanting to process my own data**,
I want **to upload CSV and PDF files for AI demo processing**,
So that **I can experience AI capabilities with my actual business data and get relevant, personalized results**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Demo execution system, file storage, user authentication
- Technology: Supabase Storage, file validation, demo execution API
- Follows pattern: Existing file handling and demo execution patterns
- Touch points: File upload interface, Supabase Storage, demo execution with file parameters

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **File Upload Interface**: Secure file upload component supporting CSV and PDF files
2. **File Validation**: File type, size, and content validation before processing
3. **Secure Storage**: Files stored securely in Supabase Storage with RLS policies
4. **Demo Integration**: Uploaded files integrated into demo execution workflows
5. **File Management**: Users can view and manage their uploaded files
6. **Processing Results**: Demo results include insights from uploaded file data

**Integration Requirements:**

7. **Demo Execution**: File uploads work with existing demo execution system
8. **User Authentication**: File access properly secured with user authentication
9. **Storage Security**: Integration with Supabase Storage RLS policies

**Quality Requirements:**

10. **Security**: Files are securely stored and access-controlled
11. **Performance**: File upload and processing doesn't impact system performance
12. **User Experience**: Clear upload progress and file management interface

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Integrate Supabase Storage with file validation and demo execution
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing file handling and security patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must be secure, handle file validation, integrate with demo system

## Definition of Done

- [ ] File upload interface component created
- [ ] File validation (type, size, content) implemented
- [ ] Supabase Storage integration with RLS policies working
- [ ] File upload integrated into demo execution workflows
- [ ] File management interface for users implemented
- [ ] Demo results processing uploaded file data
- [ ] Security audit completed for file handling
- [ ] Performance testing completed for file uploads
- [ ] User testing completed for file upload experience
- [ ] Documentation updated for file upload functionality

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in file handling or storage abuse
**Mitigation:** File validation, secure storage, access controls, size limits, content scanning
**Rollback:** Feature flag to disable file uploads, ability to remove uploaded files

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing demo execution system
- [ ] File storage doesn't impact existing database performance
- [ ] Upload interface follows existing design patterns
- [ ] Security measures don't impact other functionality
