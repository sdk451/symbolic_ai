# Story 5.5: System Observability

## User Story

As a **platform administrator and development team**,
I want **comprehensive system observability with performance tracking, error monitoring, and alerting**,
So that **I can maintain system health, quickly identify issues, and ensure optimal performance**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All system components, APIs, databases, external services, user interactions
- Technology: Observability tools (Sentry, LogRocket, APM tools), monitoring systems, alerting platforms
- Follows pattern: Existing monitoring and error tracking infrastructure
- Touch points: All system components, application performance, error tracking, user experience

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive application performance monitoring (APM) across all components
2. **Error Tracking**: Detailed error tracking and reporting with stack traces and context
3. **User Experience Monitoring**: Real user monitoring (RUM) for performance and user experience
4. **System Health Dashboards**: Real-time dashboards showing system health and performance metrics
5. **Alerting System**: Automated alerting for performance issues, errors, and system anomalies
6. **Log Analysis**: Centralized log analysis with search, filtering, and correlation capabilities

**Integration Requirements:**

7. **Existing Systems**: Observability integrated with all existing system components and monitoring
8. **Alerting Integration**: Alerts integrated with existing communication channels and escalation procedures
9. **Performance Baseline**: Observability establishes performance baselines and trend analysis

**Quality Requirements:**

10. **Proactive Detection**: Issues detected before they impact users
11. **Actionable Insights**: Observability data provides clear information for troubleshooting and optimization
12. **Historical Analysis**: Historical data available for trend analysis and capacity planning

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Implement comprehensive observability platform across all system components
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Build on existing monitoring and error tracking infrastructure
- **Key Constraints**: Must provide comprehensive coverage without impacting system performance

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Application performance monitoring deployed across all components
- [ ] Error tracking system operational with detailed reporting
- [ ] Real user monitoring implemented and functional
- [ ] System health dashboards created and accessible
- [ ] Automated alerting system configured and tested
- [ ] Log analysis system operational with search and correlation
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring systems verified
- [ ] Performance baselines established and trend analysis functional
- [ ] Observability documentation and runbooks created
- [ ] Team training completed on observability tools and procedures

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Observability overhead impacting system performance or alert fatigue
**Mitigation:** Careful configuration, performance monitoring, alert tuning and prioritization
**Rollback:** Ability to disable specific observability features or adjust monitoring levels

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing system functionality
- [ ] Observability doesn't impact system performance
- [ ] Alerting provides actionable information without creating noise
- [ ] Historical data collection doesn't impact storage or performance
