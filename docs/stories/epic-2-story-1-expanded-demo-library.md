# Story 2.1: Expanded Demo Library

## User Story

As a **dashboard user exploring AI capabilities**,
I want **access to a diverse portfolio of 10+ AI demos covering different business scenarios**,
So that **I can discover AI solutions relevant to my specific industry, role, and use cases**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing demo execution system, demo_types table, dashboard demo cards
- Technology: Supabase database, existing demo execution API, React components
- Follows pattern: Existing demo card and execution patterns
- Touch points: Demo_types table, demo execution API, dashboard demo grid

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Demo Portfolio**: 7+ additional demo cards added to existing 3-5 demos (total 10+)
2. **Diverse Use Cases**: Demos cover different business scenarios (marketing, operations, finance, HR, etc.)
3. **Persona Targeting**: Demos tagged with appropriate audience segments for filtering
4. **Demo Metadata**: Each demo includes title, description, icon, required parameters, and audience tags
5. **Execution Integration**: All new demos work with existing demo execution system

**Integration Requirements:**

6. **Existing System**: New demos integrate seamlessly with existing demo execution API
7. **Dashboard Filtering**: Demos properly filtered by persona in dashboard
8. **Database Schema**: New demos stored in existing demo_types table structure

**Quality Requirements:**

9. **Performance**: Demo library loads efficiently without impacting dashboard performance
10. **User Experience**: Clear demo descriptions and intuitive categorization
11. **Reliability**: All demos execute successfully through existing n8n workflows

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Add new records to demo_types table, ensure n8n workflows exist for each demo
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing demo card component and execution patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must work with existing demo execution system and persona filtering

## Definition of Done

- [ ] 7+ new demo records added to demo_types table
- [ ] Demo cards display correctly in dashboard with proper filtering
- [ ] All new demos execute successfully through existing API
- [ ] Demo descriptions and metadata are clear and compelling
- [ ] Persona targeting implemented for all new demos
- [ ] n8n workflows created for each new demo type
- [ ] Dashboard performance maintained with expanded demo library
- [ ] User testing completed for demo discovery and execution
- [ ] Documentation updated with new demo portfolio

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Performance degradation with larger demo library or n8n workflow complexity
**Mitigation:** Efficient database queries, lazy loading, optimized n8n workflows
**Rollback:** Ability to disable specific demos or revert to smaller demo set

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing demo execution system
- [ ] Database queries remain efficient with larger dataset
- [ ] Existing demo functionality preserved
- [ ] Dashboard performance impact is minimal
