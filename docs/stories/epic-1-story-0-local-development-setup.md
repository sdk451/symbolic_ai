# Story 1.0: Local Development Environment Setup

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Ready for Development  
**Priority:** Critical (Epic 1 - MVP Core Platform)  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 story points  
**Dependencies:** None (foundational infrastructure story)

## User Story

As a **developer working on the platform**,
I want **a fully functional local development environment with hot reloading and database access**,
So that **I can preview, test, and interact with the website locally before production deployment**.

## Story Context

**Epic 1 Integration:**
- Part of Epic 1: MVP Core Platform (see `docs/epic-1-mvp-core-platform.md`)
- Foundation for: All subsequent Epic 1 stories require this local environment
- Builds on: Existing codebase structure and technology stack

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Current Vite + React + TypeScript setup, Supabase configuration, Netlify Functions
- Technology: Vite dev server, Supabase local development, Netlify CLI, Node.js
- Follows pattern: Standard local development practices (see `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`)
- Touch points: Development server, local database, environment configuration, build processes
- **Architecture Reference**: `docs/architecture/8-environments-config.md` for environment setup

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Local Development Server**: Vite dev server running with hot reloading
   - Fast refresh for React components
   - TypeScript compilation and error reporting
   - Asset serving and bundling
2. **Database Access**: Local Supabase instance or connection to development database
   - Database migrations running locally
   - Seed data for development and testing
   - Database browser/management interface access
3. **Environment Configuration**: Proper environment variables and configuration
   - Development-specific environment variables
   - API keys and secrets for local development
   - Configuration validation and error handling
4. **Build and Deploy Tools**: Local build processes and deployment preview
   - Production build testing locally
   - Netlify CLI integration for preview deployments
   - Asset optimization and bundling verification

**Integration Requirements:**

5. **Existing Codebase**: Local environment works with current project structure
   - All existing components and pages load correctly
   - Current routing and navigation functional
   - Existing API endpoints accessible locally
6. **Development Workflow**: Streamlined development experience
   - One-command setup and start process
   - Clear documentation for new developers
   - Debugging tools and error reporting

**Quality Requirements:**

7. **Performance**: Local development server performs well
   - Fast startup time (< 10 seconds)
   - Quick hot reload (< 2 seconds)
   - Efficient memory usage
8. **Reliability**: Consistent and stable local environment
   - Environment works across different operating systems
   - Clear error messages for common issues
   - Recovery procedures for environment problems

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Set up comprehensive local development environment with all necessary tools
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow standard Vite + React development practices (see `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`)
- **Key Files to Create/Modify**:
  - `.env.local` - Local environment variables
  - `.env.example` - Environment variable template
  - `package.json` - Development scripts and dependencies
  - `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration for local development
  - `supabase/config.toml` - Local Supabase configuration
  - `docs/development-setup.md` - Local development documentation
  - `scripts/setup-dev.sh` - Automated setup script
  - `scripts/start-dev.sh` - Development server startup script
- **External Tools**: Netlify CLI, Supabase CLI, Node.js, npm/yarn
- **Key Constraints**: Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux; fast startup and reliable operation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Local development server running with hot reloading
- [ ] Database access configured and functional
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] All existing components and pages load correctly
- [ ] Build process working for production preview
- [ ] Netlify CLI integration for preview deployments
- [ ] Development documentation created and tested
- [ ] Setup scripts created and tested
- [ ] Performance requirements met (startup < 10s, reload < 2s)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] Error handling and recovery procedures documented

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Environment setup complexity or compatibility issues across different systems
**Mitigation:** Automated setup scripts, comprehensive documentation, cross-platform testing
**Rollback:** Clear uninstall procedures, fallback to basic development setup

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Compatible with existing codebase structure
- [ ] No breaking changes to production deployment
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] All development dependencies properly managed
