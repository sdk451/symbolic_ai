# Story 1.0: Local Development Environment Setup

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Review  
**Priority:** Critical (Epic 1 - MVP Core Platform)  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 story points  
**Dependencies:** None (foundational infrastructure story)

## User Story

As a **developer working on the platform**,
I want **a fully functional local development environment with hot reloading and database access**,
So that **I can preview, test, and interact with the website locally before production deployment**.

## Story Context

**Epic 1 Integration:**
- Part of Epic 1: MVP Core Platform (see `docs/epic-1-mvp-core-platform.md`)
- Foundation for: All subsequent Epic 1 stories require this local environment
- Builds on: Existing codebase structure and technology stack

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Current Vite + React + TypeScript setup, Supabase configuration, Netlify Functions
- Technology: Vite dev server, Supabase local development, Netlify CLI, Node.js
- Follows pattern: Standard local development practices (see `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`)
- Touch points: Development server, local database, environment configuration, build processes
- **Architecture Reference**: `docs/architecture/8-environments-config.md` for environment setup

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Local Development Server**: Vite dev server running with hot reloading
   - Fast refresh for React components
   - TypeScript compilation and error reporting
   - Asset serving and bundling
2. **Database Access**: Local Supabase instance or connection to development database
   - Database migrations running locally
   - Seed data for development and testing
   - Database browser/management interface access
3. **Environment Configuration**: Proper environment variables and configuration
   - Development-specific environment variables
