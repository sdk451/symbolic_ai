# Story 5.2: User Behavior Tracking

## User Story

As a **product manager and UX designer**,
I want **detailed user behavior tracking including journey analysis, heatmaps, and session recordings**,
So that **I can understand how users interact with the platform and optimize the user experience**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: User interface components, user actions, navigation flows
- Technology: Behavior tracking tools (Hotjar/LogRocket), session recording, heatmap analysis
- Follows pattern: Existing user interaction tracking and analytics patterns
- Touch points: All user interface elements, navigation flows, user interactions

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Journey Tracking**: Complete user journey mapping from landing to conversion
2. **Heatmap Analysis**: Visual heatmaps showing user interaction patterns on key pages
3. **Session Recordings**: Recorded user sessions for detailed behavior analysis
4. **Click Tracking**: Detailed click tracking and interaction analysis
5. **Form Analytics**: Form completion rates, field-level interaction analysis
6. **Mobile Behavior**: Mobile-specific behavior tracking and analysis

**Integration Requirements:**

7. **Existing UI**: Behavior tracking integrated with all existing user interface components
8. **Analytics Integration**: Behavior data integrated with existing analytics platform
9. **Privacy Compliance**: Tracking implemented with proper privacy controls and user consent

**Quality Requirements:**

10. **Privacy Protection**: User privacy protected with appropriate anonymization and consent
11. **Performance Impact**: Tracking doesn't significantly impact page load times or user experience
12. **Data Quality**: Behavior data is accurate and provides actionable insights

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Implement behavior tracking tools with privacy-compliant data collection
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Build on existing user interaction tracking and analytics infrastructure
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain user privacy while providing valuable behavioral insights
