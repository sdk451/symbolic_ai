# Story 1.5: Speed to Lead Qualification Agent Demo Implementation

**Status:** Approved  
**Priority:** High (Epic 1 - MVP Core Platform)  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 story points  
**Dependencies:** Story 1.3 (Secure Demo Execution) must be complete

## Story

**As a** dashboard user interested in AI lead qualification automation,  
**I want** to experience a complete Speed to Lead Qualification agent demo with form submission, VAPI call, and call summary display,  
**so that** I can understand how AI can automatically qualify leads and schedule appointments for my business.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Pre-populated Demo Modal Form**: When "Start Demo" is clicked for Speed to Lead Qualification agent, a modal opens with form fields for name, email, phone number, and free text request area, with name, email, and phone pre-populated from user's profile data
2. **Form Validation**: All form fields are properly validated with appropriate error messages and user feedback
3. **Webhook Integration**: Form submission triggers secure webhook request to n8n with form data and user context
4. **VAPI Call Initiation**: n8n workflow initiates VAPI agent call to the provided phone number
5. **Call Status Tracking**: User receives real-time updates about call status (initiated, in-progress, completed)
6. **Call Summary Display**: When call completes, VAPI/n8n sends summary back via webhook and displays in new modal
7. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of form submission errors, webhook failures, and call failures
8. **User Experience**: Seamless flow from demo start to call summary with clear progress indicators
9. **Data Persistence**: Demo run data stored in database with proper user association and audit trail
10. **Security Compliance**: All webhook communications use HMAC verification and follow security model

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.3 established secure demo execution patterns with HMAC webhook security
- Story 1.7 established user profile data pre-population patterns for appointment scheduler
- Existing `useDemoExecution` hook provides demo status tracking infrastructure
- Demo card system already supports different demo types and status display

### Data Models
**Source: architecture/2-data-model-v1-v2-ready.md**
- `demo_runs` table: `(id, user_id, demo_type_id, params jsonb, status enum[queued,running,succeeded,failed], started_at, finished_at, result jsonb, error text)`
- `demo_types` table: `(id, slug, name, description, icon, audience_tags text[], requires_params bool, enabled bool)`
- `profiles` table: `(user_id PK/FK, full_name, persona_segment, org_name, title, phone)`
- Lead qualification demo will use `demo_type_id` for "speed-to-lead-qualification" slug
- Form data stored in `params` jsonb field: `{name, email, phone, request}` (pre-populated from profile)
- Call summary stored in `result` jsonb field: `{callId, duration, qualificationScore, summary, nextSteps}`

### API Specifications
**Source: architecture/3-api-surface-v1.md**
- Follow existing pattern: `POST /api/demos/:demoId/run` → Auth guard, quota check, create `demo_runs`, sign + call n8n webhook
- Callback pattern: `POST /api/demos/:runId/callback` → verify HMAC, update status + result/error
- Use Hono routes + Zod parsers for input validation
- Implement idempotency key header for callbacks to prevent double updates

### Component Specifications
**Source: architecture/5-frontend-application-v1.md**
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Follow existing modal patterns from consultation booking
- Integrate with TanStack Query for data fetching and real-time updates
- Use existing demo card system for consistent user experience

### File Locations
**Source: architecture/source-tree.md**
- Modal components: `src/components/demo/LeadQualificationModal.tsx`, `src/components/demo/CallSummaryModal.tsx`
- API endpoints: `netlify/functions/api.ts` (extend existing Hono routes)
- Demo configuration: Update `src/services/dashboard.ts` for demo types
- Database migrations: `supabase/migrations/` directory

### User Profile Integration
**Source: architecture/2-data-model-v1-v2-ready.md**
- Access user profile data from `profiles` table via `user_id`
- Pre-populate form fields: `full_name`, `phone`, `email` (if available from auth)
- Handle cases where profile data is incomplete or missing
- Ensure proper data validation and sanitization before webhook transmission
- Follow established pattern from Story 1.7 for consistent user experience

### Testing Requirements
**Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, architecture/brownfield-enhancement-architecture.md**
- **Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Location**: `src/__tests__/components/` for component tests, `src/__tests__/services/` for API tests
- **Coverage**: 80%+ coverage requirement
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for API endpoints, security tests for HMAC verification
- **Setup**: Use existing test configuration in `vitest.config.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Source: architecture/4-security-model.md**
- **No direct browser calls** to n8n; all flows via server
- **HMAC** on both directions (server→n8n, n8n→server)
- **JWT validation** at every API entry; server-side persona/entitlement checks
- **RLS** for all user-facing data tables
- **Audit logs** for sensitive actions (`demo_run_started`, `demo_run_callback`)
- **Rate limiting** per user

### Project Structure Notes
- Follows existing demo execution pattern established in Story 1.3
- Integrates with existing `DemoCard` component and `useDemoExecution` hook
- Uses established webhook security patterns with HMAC verification
- Maintains consistency with existing modal and form patterns

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, architecture/brownfield-enhancement-architecture.md**
