# Story 5.4: A/B Testing Framework

## User Story

As a **product manager and marketing team**,
I want **an experimentation platform for testing features, messaging, and user experience improvements**,
So that **I can optimize conversion rates and user engagement through data-driven experimentation**.

## Story Context

**Epic 5 Integration:**
- Part of Epic 5: Analytics & Observability Platform (see `docs/epic-5-analytics-observability.md`)
- Dependencies: Requires Story 5.1 (Analytics Dashboard) and Story 5.2 (User Behavior Tracking) to be complete
- Builds on: Existing event tracking infrastructure and user segmentation system

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: User interface components, messaging systems, feature flags, analytics platform
- Technology: PostHog/LaunchDarkly for A/B testing, Supabase for data storage, Netlify Functions for API
- Follows pattern: Existing feature management and analytics infrastructure (see `docs/architecture/5-frontend-application-v1.md`)
- Touch points: All user-facing features, messaging, user experience elements
- **Architecture Reference**: `docs/architecture/7-observability.md` for monitoring patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Experiment Management**: Platform for creating, managing, and monitoring A/B tests
   - Create experiments with multiple variants (A/B/n testing)
   - Set experiment duration, traffic allocation, and success metrics
   - Pause, resume, or stop experiments based on results
2. **Feature Flag Integration**: Integration with feature flag system for experiment control
   - Dynamic feature toggling based on user variant assignment
   - Gradual rollout capabilities with percentage-based traffic allocation
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Proper statistical significance testing and experiment analysis
   - Chi-square test for conversion rate experiments
   - T-test for continuous metrics (time on page, engagement)
   - Minimum sample size calculations for statistical power
4. **Multi-variant Testing**: Support for A/B/n testing with multiple variants
   - Support for 2-5 variants per experiment
   - Equal or custom traffic allocation between variants
5. **Audience Segmentation**: Ability to target experiments to specific user segments
   - Target by persona (SMB, SOLO, EXEC, FREELANCER, ASPIRING)
   - Target by user behavior, location, or custom attributes
6. **Experiment Results**: Clear reporting of experiment results with statistical confidence
   - Real-time experiment performance dashboard
   - Statistical significance indicators and confidence intervals
   - Automated experiment completion notifications

**Integration Requirements:**

7. **Existing Features**: A/B testing integrated with existing feature management system
8. **Analytics Integration**: Experiment data integrated with existing analytics platform
9. **User Segmentation**: Integration with existing user persona and segmentation system

**Quality Requirements:**

10. **Statistical Validity**: Experiments use proper statistical methods and sample sizes
    - Minimum 95% confidence level for statistical significance
    - Power analysis to determine required sample sizes
    - Proper randomization and control for confounding variables
11. **User Experience**: Experiments don't negatively impact user experience
    - Consistent user experience within experiment variants
    - No flickering or layout shifts during variant assignment
    - Graceful fallbacks if experiment service is unavailable
12. **Data Quality**: Experiment data is accurate and reliable for decision-making
    - Real-time data collection and validation
    - Data integrity checks and anomaly detection
    - Audit trail for all experiment changes and results

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Implement A/B testing platform with feature flag integration and statistical analysis
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Build on existing feature management and analytics infrastructure (see `docs/architecture/5-frontend-application-v1.md`)
- **Key Files to Create/Modify**:
  - `src/components/ExperimentProvider.tsx` - React context for experiment management
  - `src/hooks/useExperiment.ts` - Hook for accessing experiment variants
  - `src/services/experiments.ts` - Experiment API service functions
  - `src/components/VariantRenderer.tsx` - Component for rendering experiment variants
  - `netlify/functions/experiments.ts` - API endpoints for experiment management
  - `src/pages/admin/experiments.tsx` - Admin interface for creating/managing experiments
  - `supabase/migrations/` - Add experiments, variants, and results tables
  - `src/utils/statistics.ts` - Statistical significance calculation utilities
- **External Services**: PostHog or LaunchDarkly for experiment management and feature flags
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain statistical validity while providing easy-to-use experimentation tools
