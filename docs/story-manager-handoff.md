- **Dependencies**: Critical path analysis and dependency mapping
- **Ranking**: 18 stories ranked by priority score

### 4. Development Timeline
- **Location**: `docs/development-timeline.md`
- **Structure**: 5 phases across 9 sprints (18 weeks)
- **Sequencing**: Critical path and parallel development opportunities
- **Resources**: Team allocation and capacity planning

## Critical Information for Story Manager

### Technology Stack Context
- **Frontend**: Vite + TypeScript + React
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Postgres, RLS, Realtime)
- **Hosting**: Netlify with Functions
- **Automation**: n8n webhooks with HMAC security
- **Integration**: Calendly/Cal.com for consultation booking

### Existing System Integration Points
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email verification
- **Database**: Postgres with RLS policies
- **API Layer**: Netlify Functions (consider Hono + Zod)
- **Security**: HMAC webhook authentication
- **Monitoring**: Basic analytics events

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Story 1.1** (User Auth) → **Story 1.2** (Dashboard) → **Story 1.3** (Demo System) → **Story 1.4** (Consultation)
2. **Story 1.3** enables multiple other stories (2.1, 2.3, 4.1)
3. **Stories 4.2, 4.3** can start early (infrastructure foundation)

### High-Risk Stories Requiring Special Attention
- **Story 1.3**: Secure Demo Execution (Complex webhook integration, security critical)
- **Story 4.1**: Advanced Security Model (Security implementation, compliance impact)
- **Story 2.2**: Executive Chatbot Beta (AI integration complexity, content safety)

### Business Context & Success Metrics
- **Target Users**: SMBs, solopreneurs, freelancers, executives
- **Conversion Goal**: Demo experience → Consultation booking → AI transformation partnership
- **MVP Focus**: Demos, consultation booking, basic education teasers
- **v2 Expansion**: Subscriptions, courses, enterprise features

## Story Manager Responsibilities

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Review All Stories**: Validate acceptance criteria and technical feasibility
2. **Refine Story Estimates**: Adjust story point estimates based on team capacity
3. **Validate Dependencies**: Confirm dependency mapping and critical path
4. **Create Sprint Backlogs**: Break down stories into sprint-ready tasks
5. **Establish Definition of Done**: Ensure consistent completion criteria

### Story Refinement Priorities
1. **Epic 1 Stories**: Critical path - refine first for Sprint 1-3
2. **Epic 2 Stories**: Post-MVP - refine for Sprint 4-5
3. **Epic 4 Stories**: Foundation - refine for Sprint 4-6
4. **Epic 5 Stories**: Optimization - refine for Sprint 7-8

### Technical Considerations for Refinement
- **Security**: All webhook integrations must use HMAC authentication
- **Performance**: Dashboard must load < 2 seconds, demo execution < 10 seconds
- **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA compliance required for user data
- **Scalability**: System must handle 1000+ concurrent users
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target, < 4 hour recovery time

### Integration Requirements
- **Existing Patterns**: Follow existing Supabase, Netlify, and React patterns
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- **Rollback Plans**: Each story must have rollback procedures

## Success Criteria for Handoff

### Story Manager Should Deliver
1. **Refined Story Backlogs**: Sprint-ready stories with detailed tasks
2. **Updated Estimates**: Realistic story point estimates based on team capacity
3. **Dependency Validation**: Confirmed dependency mapping and sequencing
4. **Risk Mitigation Plans**: Specific mitigation strategies for high-risk stories
5. **Sprint Planning**: Detailed sprint backlogs for first 3 sprints

### Quality Assurance Requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Each story has testable acceptance criteria
- **Integration Testing**: Stories include integration testing requirements
- **Performance Testing**: Performance benchmarks defined for each story
- **Security Testing**: Security validation requirements specified
- **User Testing**: User acceptance testing criteria established

## Communication & Collaboration

### Stakeholder Updates
