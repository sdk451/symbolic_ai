# Epic 4: Security & Infrastructure Foundation

## Epic Goal

Establish robust security architecture, infrastructure monitoring, and operational excellence to support the platform's growth from MVP through enterprise scale while maintaining data protection and system reliability.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: MVP platform with authentication, demos, and basic security measures
- Technology stack: Supabase, Netlify Functions, n8n webhooks, HMAC authentication
- Integration points: All API endpoints, webhook integrations, user data access, file uploads

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added: Comprehensive security model, infrastructure monitoring, backup systems, disaster recovery, compliance frameworks, and operational tooling
- How it integrates: Enhances existing security measures, adds monitoring to all system components, implements backup and recovery procedures
- Success criteria: Platform meets enterprise security standards, has comprehensive monitoring, maintains 99.9% uptime, and passes security audits

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Advanced Security Model - Implement comprehensive security measures including secret rotation, advanced rate limiting, DDoS protection, and security headers
2. **Story 2:** Infrastructure Monitoring & Alerting - Set up comprehensive monitoring, logging, alerting, and performance tracking across all system components
3. **Story 3:** Backup & Disaster Recovery - Implement automated backups, disaster recovery procedures, and business continuity planning
4. **Story 4:** Compliance & Audit Framework - Establish compliance procedures, audit logging, data retention policies, and privacy controls
5. **Story 5:** Operational Excellence - Create deployment automation, environment management, and operational runbooks

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Security enhancements don't break existing functionality
- [ ] Monitoring systems integrate with current infrastructure
- [ ] Backup procedures work with existing data structures
- [ ] Compliance measures align with current user agreements

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Security vulnerabilities or data breaches affecting user trust and business operations
- **Mitigation:** Regular security audits, penetration testing, comprehensive monitoring, incident response procedures
- **Rollback Plan:** Security incident response plan, ability to isolate compromised components, data recovery procedures

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Security audit passed with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Monitoring systems providing comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Compliance framework established and operational
- [ ] Operational procedures documented and team trained
- [ ] Incident response plan tested and ready
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and monitored

## Technical Implementation Notes
