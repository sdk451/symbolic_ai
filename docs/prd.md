## 2. Requirements

(‚úÖ Locked earlier + webhook refinements noted for architecture)

**MVP v1:**

* **Conversion-focused CTAs**: consultation booking highlighted in dashboard & landing.
* **Teaser previews**: lock icons on future features (courses, premium demos) to drive curiosity.
* **Mobile-friendly**: ensure usability on phones for solopreneurs/freelancers.

---

## 4. Success Metrics

**MVP Metrics:**

* % signups that complete email verification.

## 5. Risks & Mitigation
